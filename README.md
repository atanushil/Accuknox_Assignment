# [Dashboard Management](https://accuknox-assignment-tau.vercel.app/)

Welcome to the Widget Dashboard Website! This website allows users to manage and personalize a dashboard with various widgets, each displaying different types of charts. The site includes features for searching, adding, deleting widgets, and personalizing the dashboard. Also this website is designed to be fully responsive across various breakpoints:
  
**Extra Small Devices (Phones, 480px and below)**

The layout adapts to a single-column view with a hamburger menu for the navbar, and widgets are stacked vertically for optimal readability and easy scrolling.

**Small Devices (Tablets, 481px to 768px)**
![Dashboard Screenshot](/public/ExtraSmall.png)
The layout adjusts to a two-column view where possible, with the navbar remaining a hamburger menu but offering more space for items, while widgets are displayed in a grid format with fewer columns to maintain clarity.

**Medium Devices (Small Laptops, 769px to 1024px)**

The layout switches to a three-column view, with the navbar potentially displaying more items and reducing reliance on the hamburger menu, while widgets are organized in a more compact grid.

**Large Devices (Desktops, 1025px and above)**

The layout utilizes the full multi-column design for maximum screen space, with the navbar fully expanded and all links visible, and widgets displayed in a flexible grid layout to effectively use the larger screen size.
